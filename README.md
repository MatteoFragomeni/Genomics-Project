# Integration of Genomic Data and Bioinformatics Tools for Molecular Diagnosis in Five Clinical Cases

## Introduction

This project aims to investigate and interpret genetic variants from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data in five individual clinical cases, integrating public genomic databases and bioinformatics tools. The main goal is to evaluate the pathogenicity of rare genetic variants potentially associated with disease phenotypes and to assess the likelihood of causative relationships.

Through the use of tools such as Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), gnomAD, ClinVar, OMIM, and the Genomics England PanelApp (G2P/DDD), each variant was analyzed for its functional consequence, population frequency, clinical significance, and gene-disease association. The cases are discussed individually, with careful consideration of variant type, inheritance, and available literature.

## Repository Contents

- `VEP_output/` – Annotated variant files generated with Ensembl VEP  
- `MultiQC_report/` – Quality control summary of sequencing data  
- `Coverage_tracks/` – Coverage visualization files for specific genomic regions

The project reflects a practical application of clinical genomics and variant curation in the context of rare disease diagnostics.
